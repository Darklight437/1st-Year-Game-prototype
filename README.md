# 1st-Year-Game-prototype
The prototype/vertical slice that our 1st year team will produce

Short explanation on GitHub:
github creates a server mirror of the content of this folder and will attempt to merge any text files in the folder
for non text files it will treat them as alien beyond the name and will just replace them on push

when you push it will record exactly the changes you made and request a title and description for the push 
describe the type of content (models, animations code etc).
and provide a short description of changes

we are able to roll back to old versions and will keep a version of the current best stable build

(ask the programmers for details beyond this & how to use)
